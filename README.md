# VirtualMouseOpenCv
This project is based on computer vision and it is implemented using modules like opencv numpy and mediapipe framework . The objective behind the project is to make the index finger functional as the mouse pointer. For the implementation of the features of mouse pointer pyautogui module is used. PyAutoGUI lets the Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications. MediaPipe Hands is a high-fidelity hand and finger tracking solution. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer 21 3D landmarks of a hand from just a single frame.
